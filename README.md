# WeatherPredictor
A Machine Learning project predicting the summary of weather by using the given dataset. It is an example of multiclass classification in which we were supposed to predict the class (Weather Summary). There are around 12 classes but for the sake of simplicity, we have worked on only 3 classes but classes can be selected as many as of user's choice.

You can easily download the dataset named "weatherHistory.csv" from kaggle. Make sure to apply all preprocessing steps.
